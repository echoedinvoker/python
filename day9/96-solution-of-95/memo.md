## **Lector's Flowchart**

- lector's path in "No" does not do the clear screen action, unlike the app in his own example video before.
  - So there is little difference between ask and if, so it is obvious that lector is represented by a single unit.

## **Lector's Script**

### _Codes for one purpose -> function_

![Alt compare to lector's codes](pic/02.jpg)

- By wrapping a group of codes that accomplish a single purpose into a single function, the readability of the script is improved.
- The way I originally wrote it, the codes after the while would be equivalent to "if has_other ! = 'no'", which of course would be more difficult to understand.

### _TypeError_
