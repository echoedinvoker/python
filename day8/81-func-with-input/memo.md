- Wouldn't it be too much trouble if I had to change the function definition every time? Is there a more convenient way?

## **Use parameter and argument**

> function allows us to call it in a way that allows us to give it some value to vary the result it produces.

- Instead of using the terms "variable" or "value", we use "parameter" and "argument" in this process to transfer data from the outside to the function, as above.
