### _Get Data from replit_

> Because the sharing feature of replit is still very convenient, so the data written by lector for us is put on replit, and we have to copy it to the pyCharm file ourselves.

![Alt pyCharm: move data to data.py](pic/16.jpg)

![Alt pyCharm: import data to main.py](pic/17.jpg)

### _TODO_

> pyCharm has a TODO tracking feature, which makes it easier for us to break down our work into smaller chunks.
