## **Challenge: Create Paddle class and Use it to create two paddles**

![Alt Challenge: build Paddle class and create left & right paddle](pic/01.jpg)

## **My solution**

> Because I had already done the Paddle class in the previous lecture, I only need to change the position part to an initializable parameter of the class in this lecture.

## **Result**

![Alt result](pic/03.jpg)

- The lector is made so that both paddles are human-operated, but I only made the left paddle human-operated to make the game suitable for single player.
