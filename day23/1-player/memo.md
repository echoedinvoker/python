- lector has written some constants and screen parts for us, but has not yet drawn any turtle.

## **Draw init status of turtle**

> Let's start with the initial state and not think about making other complicated parts, because everything is difficult at the beginning, so let's try to make the beginning as simple as possible.

## **Implement process when turtle reach the end line**

> We are only writing about what turtle should be doing here, so don't think about points or vehicle resets or anything like that.
