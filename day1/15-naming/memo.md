## **Better Meaningfull Naming**

![Alt meaningfull name](pic/01.jpg)

- It is better to give meaning to the name of the variable to make it readable.

## **Naming rules**

### _may not contain space_

![Alt no space](pic/02.jpg)

### _may not start with number_

![Alt don't start with number](pic/03.jpg)

## **SyntaxError**

> If the naming rules are not followed, you will get SyntaxError.

![Alt SyntaxError1](pic/04.jpg)

![Alt SyntaxError2](pic/05.jpg)

## **NameError**

![Alt NameError](pic/06.jpg)

- When you get NameError, there may be a typo error.

## **Do not use existed function names to naming**

![Alt](pic/07.jpg)

- This will directly cause this function to not work properly in the future.
- Usually the IDE uses color to tell us if we've made this mistake.
