## **Flowchart by myself**

- Use multiple-if as much as possible, but I don't see any places can be optimized.
- Another thing that makes me hesitate is whether the details of the front-end presentation should also be drawn into the flowchart, for example, Dealer's card row only shows the first one.
  - My choice is not to draw in, as long as the data processing logic is correct first, the front-end presentation part is not included in order to avoid the flow chart becomes more complex.
  - On the other hand, I think that as long as the data is correct, it is easy to modify the front-end presentation at the end.
