## **Codes compare with flowchart**

![Alt codes compare to flowchart 1 (DRY func)](pic/07.jpg)

![Alt codes compare to flowchart 2 (recursion)](pic/08.jpg)

## **Thonny check**

### _Indent mistake_

![Alt I thought its indent mistake... (Thonny)](pic/01.jpg)

![Alt fix indent mistake and forgot sum again after drawing (Thonny)](pic/02.jpg)

### _Lack of sum() after drawing_

![Alt fix sum again (Thonny)](pic/03.jpg)

### _Multiple-if in the same while loop_

![Alt set while condition as a variable, because multiple if in same while (Thonny)](pic/04.jpg)

### _Pass function "value" into function_

![Alt if I just written compare operation in parameter, it is just simple value, never calc again (Thonny)](pic/05.jpg)

![Alt create two func for passing into parameters of dead_or_A func (Thonny)](pic/06.jpg)

![Alt adjust dead_or_A func define (Thonny)](pic/09.jpg)

![Alt call dead_or_A func and pass cond_ func "value" into it (Thonny)](pic/10.jpg)

## **Back to flowchart level to solve the logic problem**

![Alt stuck in the while loop (Thonny)](pic/11.jpg)

![Alt stick with flowchart to solve the stuck problem, don't lost in the codes (Thonny)](pic/12.jpg)
