## **Indent**

> In Python, we use indentation to define whether an instruction belongs to a function or statement.

## **Multiple Instructions and Indent**

![Alt keep indented instructions](pic/03.jpg)

- When there are multiple lines of instructions that must belong to a function or statement, the indentation is used continuously.

- When the indentation ends, the scope of instructions defined by the function or statement is aborted.

## **How to indent? Tab or spaces?**

- In practice, mixing space and tab is forbidden in Python3, so explicitly specify indent = 4 spaces.

- However, most IDEs or text editors have a capability to automatically convert Tabs to spaces, so we can still use Tabs for indentation when writing programs.
