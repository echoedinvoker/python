## **Challenge: Various Countdown According to Different Type of Sessions**

### _Instructions_

![Alt challenge: different session countdown](pic/01.jpg)

### _Constants and Attribute_

![Alt set constants and reps](pic/02.jpg)

### _Logic_

![Alt edit count_start() with if-statement for diff reps](pic/03.jpg)

## **Test > Problem: Multi-Countdowns at the same time**

### _Description_

![Alt test it but multi-countdowns at the same time](pic/04.jpg)

### _New attribute for recording timer id_

![Alt set new attr to record .after id](pic/05.jpg)

### _Logic to cancel timer_

![Alt record .after id and cancel it](pic/06.jpg)

- This part is somewhat similar to JavaScript's setTimer.

## **Challenge: Various number of marks According to Different Sessions**

### _New Attribute_

![Alt add attr to set num of marks](pic/07.jpg)

### _Re-render marks logic_

![Alt re-render marks in count_start](pic/08.jpg)

### _DRY_

![Alt split it to another method to DRY](pic/09.jpg)

### _TEST_

![Alt test it and works fine](pic/10.jpg)

## **Challenge: Reset**

### _Reset logic_

![Alt create reset method](pic/11.jpg)

### _DRY_

![Alt create cancel_countdown() to DRY](pic/12.jpg)

## **Challenge: Various Lable during different Sessions**

### _Instruction_

### _Logic & Using method for increasing readibility_

![Alt create render_title() and use it to render labels](pic/14.jpg)

## **Compare to lector's way**

### _Drawing Marks_

![Alt compare to lector: don't need self.mark_num](pic/15.jpg)

![Alt compare to lector: use diff logic to re-render marks](pic/16.jpg)

### _Reset_

![Alt compare to lector: new reset()](pic/17.jpg)

## **Optimize**

![Alt more constants](pic/18.jpg)

![Alt replace with constants 1](pic/19.jpg)

![Alt replace with constants 2](pic/20.jpg)
